m_customaccel_exponent "0"      
// Mouse move is raised to this power before being scaled by scale factor.

m_customaccel_max "0"             
// Max mouse move scale factor, 0 for no limit

m_customaccel_scale "0"           
// Custom mouse acceleration value.

m_filter "0"                              
// Mouse filtering smooths input averaged over last two frames. In other words, it smooths mouse movement at the cost of accuracy.

// Mouse forward factor.

m_mouseaccel1 "0"                   
// Windows mouse acceleration initial threshold (2x movement).

// Windows mouse acceleration secondary threshold (4x movement).

m_mousespeed "1"                    
// Windows mouse speed factor (range 1 to 20).

// Mouse pitch factor.

m_side "0.8"                            
// Mouse side factor.

m_yaw "0.022"                        
// Mouse yaw factor.
